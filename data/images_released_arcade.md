## Platform Overrides for Arcade Cores

Arcade cores are currently split up into two categories: **Arcade** and **Arcade Multi**. 

- If an arcade board supports multiple noteworthy games, then I put into into the **Arcade Multi** category.  All of the Arcade Multi images are follow a particular image format. 

- If an arcade board only supports a single game or a single noteworthy game, then it's in the **Arcade** category, and the image is either the original marquee used in arcades, or an image created from key artwork. 

All artwork used is meant to be official artwork from the time of the game's release. I try to avoid using fanart.
